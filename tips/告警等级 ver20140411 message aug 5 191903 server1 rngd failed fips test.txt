----------------------------------
The FIPS test is something done on government or more secure organizations for extra security check . 
So everywhere else it will not be used , so when i started a new process called rngd
on my server by default it is doing the FIPS test which was failing . 

So linux had marked it down after certain attempts which is what showing below.
	Apr 1 08:12:05 sap01 rngd: failed fips test
	Apr 1 08:12:05 sap01 rngd: too many FIPS failures, disabling entropy source
	Apr 1 08:12:05 sap01 ranged: No entropy sources working, exiting rngd"

rngd man pages , found an option to ignore: 
   -i, --ignorefail
		  Ignore repeated fips failures

Running as below will not generate the error:
	/sbin/rngd -r /dev/urandom -o /dev/random -t 1 -i
	/sbin/rngd -r /dev/urandom -o /dev/random -t 20 -i
