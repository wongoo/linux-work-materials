If you use the -i option you need to provide an extension for your backups.

If you have:
  File1.txt
  File2.cfg

The command:
  sed -i '.original' 's/old_link/new_link/g' *

create 2 backup files like:
  File1.txt.original
  File2.cfg.original

There is no portable way to avoid making backup files because is impossible to find a mix of sed commands that works on all cases:

sed -i -e ... - does not work on OS X as it creates -e backups
sed -i'' -e ... - does not work on OS X 10.6 but works on 10.9+
sed -i '' -e ... - not working on GNU
